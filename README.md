# couch_surfing_exercise

Firt adventure using Flutter. Figured out enough to do the following:

1. Load json mock data for user posts from friends.
2. Setup widgets within and across multiple files for some organization.
3. Setup basic some UI Widgets for a visual layout.
4. Load network images from urls in the mock data.
5. work with state and pass properties into children.
